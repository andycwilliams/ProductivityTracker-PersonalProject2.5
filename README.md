# Daily Productivity Tracker
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
Tracker to plan out productivity for the day, whether by the Pomodoro Technique or a custom schedule. My submission for University of Oregpn's Full-Stack Development Boot Camp personal project. Designed to be intuitive and ease anxiety, not end up causing it as with other productivity tools.
