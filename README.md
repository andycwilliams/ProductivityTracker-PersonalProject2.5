# Daily Productivity Tracker
Tracker to plan out productivity for the day, whether by the Pomodoro Technique or a custom schedule. 
My submission for University of Oregpn's Full-Stack Development Boot Camp personal project.

Try NOT to use express by default. It has a lot of boilerplate design for huge solutions.
Lambda (sic? designs are more modular with specific methods (e.g. 3-4 discreet operations).

## Potential inclusions: 
* Begins with template
* Has tips for more effective study and retention
* Tracks productivity over the day/week/month
* Built in timer, default is 25 minutes but can be customized. Alerts user to take a break (5 minutes by default)

## MVPs: 

Stretch goals:
Leaderboard, compare results with friends, compare rates to past/average
Light and dark modes
