            <h1>Background info (e.g. on the mind)</h1>
            <div>
                <p>The single biggest source of distractions is our own minds. The best way to deal with these iterrupting thoughts is to accept them
                and not punish ourselves over it. Write them down to deal with after your focus session is over. Lets you decide how important they reall are.</p>
                <p>Too many of these is how our brains tell us we're not in a focused state. It often feels like we have to take care of it right away if not 
                    just write them down before we forget. Usually we can put off these for as little as 25 minutes.</p>
                <p>The importance of developing habits</p>
                <p>Two interrelated things about time: Becoming and the Succession of Events. Becoming is the process of representing time in a dimension. This extends to
                    things like the concept of duration of events and being early or late</p>
                <p>The Succession of Events is represneted by our daily process such as waking up, eating breakfast, getting ready for the day, etc. 
                    It also involves the concept of time progressing even without these events occurring.</p>
                <p>Becoming is the one that causes us anxiety because it is by definition abstract and intangible. We see ourselves as more concrete, so when we 
                    comparing ourselves against it, we invariably feel like we don't measure up. It saps us of motivation and feelings of accomplishment.</p>
                <p>You can train yourself to no longer focus on Becoming and ease anxiety</p>
                <p>Why so many productivity systems fail: They add another layer of complexity on an already complex process.
                    It only distracts us more.</p>
