            <h5 class="center">Background info (e.g. on the mind)</h5>

            <p class="light">The single biggest source of distractions is our own minds. The best way to deal with these iterrupting thoughts is to accept them
                and not punish ourselves over it. Write them down to deal with after your focus session is over. Lets you decide how important they reall are.</p>
            <p>Too many of these is how our brains tell us we're not in a focused state. It often feels like we have to take care of it right away if not 
                just write them down before we forget. Usually we can put off these for as little as 25 minutes.</p>
            <p>The importance of developing habits</p>
            <p>Two interrelated things about time: Becoming and the Succession of Events. Becoming is the process of representing time in a dimension. This extends to
                things like the concept of duration of events and being early or late</p>
            <p>The Succession of Events is represneted by our daily process such as waking up, eating breakfast, getting ready for the day, etc. 
                It also involves the concept of time progressing even without these events occurring.</p>
            <p>Becoming is the one that causes us anxiety because it is by definition abstract and intangible. We see ourselves as more concrete, so when we 
                comparing ourselves against it, we invariably feel like we don't measure up. It saps us of motivation and feelings of accomplishment.</p>
            <p>You can train yourself to no longer focus on Becoming and ease anxiety</p>
            <p>Why so many productivity systems fail: They add another layer of complexity on an already complex process.
                It only distracts us more.</p>
            <p>A session is indivisible. If interrupted, it has to be done over again.</p>
            <p>During your break, you must separate completely from your work and allow yourself to process what you've just studied.
              Take a walk, drink water, meditate, stretch, anything that lets you relax mental effort. That means no important messages, for instance.
              Don't think about what you were just doing.</p>
            <p>Keep working on the same task until it's done, then cross it off.</p>
            <p>Every FOUR sessions, stop the task and take a longer break (15-30 minutes). Good time to tidy your workspace, get more coffee or tea,
              check mail, light exercise. Still nothing especially complex. Otherwise you won't be able to integrate what you did during the session.</p>
            <p>If you finish your task before the session ends, use the time to review or recall what you just did, make improvements, etc.</p>
            <p>At end of day, completed sessions can be transferred to the Archive Sheet/Spreadsheet/Database</p>
            <p>Recording the start time isn't as important as the number of sessions you did. It's still helpful though if you want to keep track of it.</p>
            <p>This also helps you find out how long it takes to complete each task. If one kind of activity takes you 5 sessions, for example, 
              then next time you can aim for 4. This will help improve your efficiency.</p>
            <ul>Reducing Distractions
              <li>Intentionality. Make them clearly visible. Every time you feel a potnetial interruption, put a mark on the sheet and
                (such as "*"). Then make a decision about what to do.
              </li>
              <ul>Either
                <ol>Write down new activity in the To Do Daily Sheet under "Unplanned & Urgent" if it can't be postponed</ol>
                <ol>Write it in the Activity Inventory, marking with another symbol (such as "U") with a deadline (if applicable)</ol>
                <ol>Intensify your focus to complete the current session after marking it</ol>
              </ul>
            </ul> 
            <p>It's easy to come up with tons of tasks that feel urgent but afterwards may not be quite so important.
              They can sometimes even be erased.</p>
            <p>As you record your distractions, you can learn more about how many you tend to get and what kinds are most common.</p>
            <p>Make external interruptions visible. Every time one arises, mark it with another symbol (such as "-"). 
              Then figure out how you want to approach it, depending on how urgent it is.</p>
            <p>You can reserve one session per day to address urgent distractions.</p>
            <p>Estimate how many sessions each task will take, using only whole numbers. If it's more than 5, break it into smaller,
              more completable pieces. Estimate each of those pieces. Anything that will take less than one full session can be
              grouped together into full session. </p>
            <p>Estimate how many sessions you will be able to do in the day, then divide your tasks among them.</p>
            <p>If the task is estimated to require at least three sessions, consider why estimating is so complicated. Over time,
              you'll be able to reduce the number of of estimates.</p>
            <p>Not every task can be estimated. You can use the session to explore and plan out that task.</p>
